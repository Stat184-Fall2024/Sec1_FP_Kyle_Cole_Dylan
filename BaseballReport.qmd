### Computing wins above replacement (WAR)

## Position players

# Using Baseball Reference's definition of WAR (aka bWAR)

AVG_RUNS_PER_WIN = 10 # Constant for average number of runs per win, Baseball Reference assumes this is 10 

# Compute the average runs per at bat across the league
avg_runs_per_ab <- mean(teams$R / teams$AB)
# Replacement level is 80% of the league average
replacement_level_runs_per_ab = avg_runs_per_ab * 0.8

# Compute bWAR for 21st century Yankees players
nyy_batting <- batting %>%
  # Filter cases to 21st century Yankees players
  filter(yearID > 1999 & teamID == "NYA") %>%
  # Add columns for the WAR computation
  mutate(
    TB = H + X2B + 2 * X3B + 3 * HR, # total bases (TB)
    RC = ifelse((AB + BB) > 0, (H + BB) * TB / (AB + BB), 0), # runs created (RC)
    replacement_level_runs = replacement_level_runs_per_ab * AB, # replacement runs
    runs_above_replacement = RC - replacement_level_runs, # runs above replacement
    WAR = runs_above_replacement / AVG_RUNS_PER_WIN # bWAR
  ) %>%
  # Sort by descending WAR
  arrange(desc(WAR)) %>%
  # Drop all columns beside playerID, yearID, teamID, WAR
  select(playerID, yearID, teamID, WAR)

# For validation purposes, 2007 Alex Rodriguez' WAR was about 9.2

**Project Description:**

The goal of this final R project is to analyze the percentage of a team's salary cap allocated to specific players from 2000 to now and to explore the factors driving these players' compensation levels.

**Questions to answer:**

-   **Player Salary Insights**

    -   How does the percentage of salary cap each player earns correlate with their performance metrics (e.g., batting average, home runs, WAR)?

    -   What is the distribution of salaries across different positions (pitcher, catcher, etc.) for the Yankees compared to other teams?

-   **Team-Level Analysis**

    -   How does the Yankees' average player salary compare to that of other MLB teams?

    -   What percentage of the Yankees' salary cap is spent on top-performing players compared to the league average?

-   **Historical Trends**

    -   How has the percentage of the salary cap allocated to top-paid players changed over the years for the Yankees and other teams?

    -   Are there trends in salary allocation related to team performance in playoffs or championships?

-   **Position-Based Analysis**

    -   Are certain positions (e.g., pitchers, shortstops) allocated a higher percentage of the salary cap across MLB teams? How does this compare with the Yankees?

    -   Do players in specific positions receive more or less than their performance justifies?

-   **Team Strategy Insights**

    -   Does a higher percentage of salary cap spent on star players correlate with better overall team performance?

    -   How do the Yankees' salary allocation strategies compare to teams with similar or better performance records?

-   **League-Wide Comparisons**

    -   How do the Yankees rank in terms of salary cap utilization efficiency compared to other MLB teams?

    -   Are there any anomalies or outliers in salary allocations across the league?

-   **Contract Lengths and Salaries**

    -   Do longer contracts for Yankees players correlate with a higher percentage of the salary cap allocation?

    -   How does contract length influence the perceived value of players?

-   **Demographics and Salaries**

    -   Are there correlations between player age, experience, or nationality and the percentage of the salary cap they receive?

    -   How do rookie salaries as a percentage of salary caps compare between the Yankees and other teams?

-   **Revenue vs. Salaries**

    -   Does the Yankees' revenue have a stronger correlation with salary cap allocations compared to other teams?

    -   How does team revenue impact the overall spending strategy on players?

Note: At some point in analysis, define equations for WAR
